# Censorship_Paper (2021 Spring) 

In this paper, I worked with my colleague to produce a paper on understanding how different types of censorship affect the popularity of democratic governments.
By combining various datasets and manipulating the data, we built several regression models showing that that an increase in internet censorship significantly
increases the democratic government approval rate only when there is a large population of onliner users; while an increase of censorship in traditional media can lead to lower
popularity of democratic governments.
